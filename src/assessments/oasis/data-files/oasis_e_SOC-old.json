Sequencing of diagnoses should reflect the seriousness of each condition and support the disciplines and services provided. &#x0D; &#x0D; Column 2: Enter the ICD-10-CM code for the condition described in Column 1 - no surgical or procedure codes allowed.

Do not assign a symptom control rating if the diagnosis code is a V, W, X, Y or Z-code. Choose one value that represents the degree of symptom control appropriate for each diagnosis using the following scale: &#x0D; 0 - Asymptomatic, no treatment needed at this time &#x0D; 1 - Symptoms well controlled with current therapy &#x0D; 2 - Symptoms controlled with difficulty, affecting daily functioning; patient needs ongoing monitoring &#x0D; 3 - Symptoms poorly controlled; patient needs frequent adjustment in treatment and dose monitoring &#x0D; 4 - Symptoms poorly controlled; history of re-hospitalizations &#x0D; Note that the rating for symptom control in Column 2 should not be used to determine the sequencing of the diagnoses listed in Column 1.
